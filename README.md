# Processes, Threads, Concurrency exercise practice
Practice exercises from my education in Computer Science. Exercises in Processes, Threads, and Concurrency.

The exercises helped me gain a better understanding of the topics.

The original code can be seen here: https://github.com/goldfingyr/DMA-CSD-S233

I've only made small changes to some of the code. My primary goal was to get an understanding of the topic.

## Topics
- Processes - How to start a process
- Threads - How to make a thread using 'extends Thread' and 'implement Runnable'.
- Semaphores - Synchronization to prevent deadlock
- Circular buffer - Data structure
- FIFO (First in, First out)
